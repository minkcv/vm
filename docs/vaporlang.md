# Vaporlang
This file describes the syntax of the provided compiler. The language is slightly higher level than assembly.

Vaporlang supports named global variables, constants, functions, control flow, loops, memory access, and some operators.
Variable declarations and assignments must end in semicolons. Functions and control flow blocks must be bounded by open and close curly braces `{`,`}`.
The compiler is very whitespace sensitive, not in terms of logic (like python), but in terms of parsing.
The compiler stores variables and the call stack in memory segments 59 through 63 (inclusive). The maximum number of variables is 1024 and the maximum call stack size is 127 calls.
There is no main function, code execution starts at the top of the file and can enter into functions from above them. 

#### Logging
The compiler can log source code and instruction addresses to the output assembly. This can be useful when debugging the vm by allowing you to cross reference assembly addresses with  Use `-l a` to log instruction addresses, `-l s` to log source code, or `-l sa` to log both.

    ./compiler -f myprogram.vapor -l sa

#### Comments
Comments begin with two forward slashes. Anything on the same line as a comment that comes after the slashes will be ignored by the compiler.

    // Whole line comment
    var test;// Comment after declaration
    var test2;      //After a bunch of whitespace

#### Constants
Constants are declared with `const`. Constants are faster than variables in terms of execution and should be used in favor of variables when possible. Constants can be values 0 through 255.

    const width 16;

#### Variables
Variables are declared with `var`. All variables have global scope and must be declared before being used. Variables can only hold values 0 through 255 (a byte). Variables cannot be initialized when declared.

    var xposition;

#### Assignment
Variables can have values stored in them using the assignment operator `=`. The right hand side of the `=` must either be another variable, literal integer, memory access, or complex expression. The left hand side of the `=` can be a variable or memory access. Multiple assignment in one statement is not valid.

    // Valid
    xposition = 5;
    xposition = xposition + 1;
    // Not valid
    xposition = yposition = 0;

#### Control flow
Conditionally execute, repeat, or skip code using `if` or `while`. The code will be executed if the condition is non-zero.

    while 1 {
        // infinite loop
        // unless return is used
    }
    if 0 {
        // unreachable code
    }
    if i {
        // executes if i != 0
    }

#### Comparison
Variables can be compared for equality `==`, `!=`, less than `<`, and greater than `>`. 0 indicates false and 1 indicates true. Comparisons can be done in while loop and if conditions, as well as have their result assigned to variables and memory. Comparisons will be evaluated after both sides of the operator have evaluated.

    xIsZero = xposition == 0;
    xIsNotZero = xposition != 0;
    xAboveOne = xposition > 1;
    if xIsZero {
        xposition = 1;
    }
    while xposition < 10 {
        xposition = xposition + 1;
    }

#### Other Operators
Other operators include addition `+`, subtraction `-`, bitwise and `&`, bitwise or `|`, bitwise xor `^`, bitwise not `~`, shift left `<<`, and shift right `>>`. Compound use of operators is supported except for not `~` and the order of operations is right to left, except that comparisons will be done after these operators.

    xposition = xposition - 1;
    xposition = xposition & yposition;
    xposition = ~ xposition;

    // xposition = (xposition - (1 + (1 -3)));
    xposition = xposition - 1 + 1 - 3;

    // xposition = (xposition & yposition) == (1 + (2 - 3));
    xposition = xposition & yposition == 1 + 2 - 3;

#### Functions
Functions are declared with `func <name> {` and must have a closing `}`. Functions implicitly return at `}` and can explicitly return at `return`. Functions can be called before declared. 

    call move;

    func move {
        if xposition > 125 {
            return;
        }
        xposition = xposition + 2;
    }

#### Memory Access
Addressing memory is done with brackets `[`, `]` via segment and offset. The whitespace around the the brackets and comma is necessary. Operators (other than `=`) cannot go after memory access.

    // Valid
    [ 0 , index ] = 1;
    [ 0 , index + 1 ] = 2;
    xposition = xposition + [ 0 , index ];
    // Not valid
    xposition = [ 0 , index ] + 1;
